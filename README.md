# Model Pipeline

A machine learning pipeline have diferents steps

## Data Analysis

We need to get a good understanding of what the data is telling us. It is a good practice to know the data well, to get familiar with the varaibles, to know how the variables are related to ecah other and to what we want to predict.
If the model is a supervised case, we need to know what varaibles we can use.

## Feature Engineering

WE define we can use the varaibles as they are or if we need to transform them before passing them onto a machine learning algorim. By feature engineering we mean fill in missing values and coding categorical variables.

## Feature Selection

Feature selection mean finding those varaibles that are the most predictive ones and build the models using only those varaibles instead of the entire dataset.

## Machine Learning Model Building

Tipically build many different machine learning algorithms, analize their performance and choose the one or the few ones that give us the best results. We typically evaluate many stattistical metrics.
